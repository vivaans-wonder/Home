I like Messi because he is very hardworking.My Favourite ṭeam is Chelsea. Ever since I started to learn coding, I loved it. I was very excited to make my apps, websites, etc. Givemefive.ai is a very good website you can learn coding from. Sumanth sir (My coding sir) helps me when I don’t understand something and even helps me in my projects. I am very grateful to him.
